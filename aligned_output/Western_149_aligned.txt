[G]Every [D/F#]valley shall [Gbm]be [G]exalted, And [D]every [Gmaj7]hill [A]made low,
[D]And all God’s people shall see [G]together, The [A7]glory [G]of [A]the [D]Lord.
[D]1. A [Gbm]voice cries [Bm]out in the wilderness, [Em]“Prepare the [A6]way of the [D]Lord.
[D]Make [E7]straight in the desert a highway,
[E7]A [D]highway [E6]for our [A]God”
[D/F#]Comfort all my [Gbm]people, [G6]The time [D]for [G]war [A]is gone,
[D/A]The [A]blind [D]shall see, the deaf [Gmaj7]shall hear, [A6]The [Gmaj7]lame [A]shall [D]leap for [Bm]joy.
[Bm]Stand upon [Em]the mountain [G]top, Lift [A]up your [Bm]voice to the world, Sing [Gbm]joyfully, Jerusalem, Behold, [Bm]behold your God!
