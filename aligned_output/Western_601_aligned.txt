[F]Though the [Bb]mountains may [F]fall, and the [Eb]hills turn to [Cm7]dust, Yet the [Bbmaj7]love of the [G7]Lord will [Cm]stand,
[F6]As a [Bb]shelter for [F]all who will [Eb]call on His name, Sing [Bb]the praise and the [F7]glory of [Ebmaj7]God.
[Eb]1. [D]Could [A]the Lord [Dm]ever leave you? Could the Lord [Cm7]forget [Bb]His [Eb]love? [G]Though [Am]a mother [Dm]forsake her child, He will not [F]abandon you.
[F]2. [Bb]Should you [F]turn and forsake [Ebmaj7]Him, He will [Cm7]gently [Eb]call your [Bbmaj7]name. Should [G7]you wander away [Cm]from [Dm]Him, He [Bb]will always [F]take you back.
[Ebmaj7]3. Go to Him [Bb]when you’re weary, He will [F7]give you [Eb]eagle’s [Bb]wings. [D]You [Am]will run, never [Dm]tire, [F]for your, [Eb]God will be [Bb]your [Eb]strength.
[G]4. [Am]As He [Dm]swore to your fathers, When [Cm7]the flood [F]destroyed the [Bb]land, He will [F]never forsake you.
[Ebmaj7]He will swear [Cm]to you [Bbmaj7]again.
