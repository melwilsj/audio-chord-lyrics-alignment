[Db]A new [Fm]commandment [Db]I [Gb]give unto you,
[Ab]That you love [Db]one [Bbm]another as [Gb]I [Ebm]have loved [Ab7]you. (2)1.
[Ab7]By this shall [Fm]all [Bbm]know, [Gb]that [Ab]you are [Db]My disciples,
[Db]If [Fm]you [Db]have [Gb]love [Gbm]for [Ab]one another.
[Ab]2. You [Fm]are My [Bbm]friends, [Ebm7]if you do [Ab]what I command you,
[Fm]Without [Bbm]My help [Gb]you [Ab]can do [Db]nothing.
[Db]3. [Gb]I am [Ab]the true Vine, [Db]My Father is the gardener,
[Db]Abide [Gb]in [Db]Me and I [Ab]in [Db]you.
[Db]4. [Gb]Now [Ab]love is patient, not [Fm]arrogant nor boastful,
[Db]Love [Gb]bears all [Db]things, love is [Ab7]eternal.
[Db]5.
