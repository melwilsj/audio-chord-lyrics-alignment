[G]1. I give my hands to do [Am]Your work, And, [D7]Jesus Lord, I give them [G]willingly. I give my feet to go [Am]Your way,
[Am]And [D]every step I shall take cheerfully.
[G]O the joy of the Lord is my [Am]strength, my strength, O the [D7]joy of the Lord is my [G]help, my help,
[G]For the power of His Spirit is [Am]in my heart, And [D]the joy of the Lord is my [C/G]strength.
[C/G]2. I [G]give my eyes to see [Am]the world,
[Am]And every [D7]one in just the way [G]You do.
[G]I give my tongue to speak [Am]Your words,
[Am]To spread [D7]Your name and freedom [G]giving truth.
[G]3. [Cmaj7]I give my mind in [Am]every way,
[Am]So that each thought [D7]I have will come from You. [G]I give my spirit to You, Lord,
[G]And every day [Am]my prayer will spring [D7]anew.
[D7]4. I give my heart that You [C]may [G]love,
[G]In me Your Father [Am]and the human [D7]race. I give myself that You may [G]grow,
[G]In me and make my life [Am]a song of [D7]praise.
[D7]5.
