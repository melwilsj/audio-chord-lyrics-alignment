[B]Follow Me, follow Me, leave your [E]home and family, [B]Leave your fishing nets and [E]boats upon the [Dbm]shore, [Gbm]Leave the seed [Gb]that you have [B]sown,
[B]Leave the [E]crops that you have grown,
[E]Leave [B]the people you have known and follow Me.
[B]1. The [Dbm]foxes [Gb]have their holes,
[Gb]And the swallows [B]have their nests,
[B]But the Son of Man [E]has no place to [Bbm]lie down.
[Dbm]I do [Abm]not offer [Gb]comfort, [E]I do not offer wealth,
[E]But in [Gb]Me will all happiness [B]be found.
[B]2. If you would [E]follow Me,
[E]You must [B]leave old ways behind,
[B]You [E]must take [Abm]My [Dbm]cross [Gbm]and follow [B]on My path.
[B]You may be far [E]from loved ones, You [B]may be far from home,
[B]But [Gb]My Father will [B]welcome
