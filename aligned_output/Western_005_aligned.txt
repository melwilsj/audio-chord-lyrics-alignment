[Eb]1. [Bb]Above [Ebdim]all [F]powers, above [Bb]all kings,
[Bb]Above [Ebdim]all nature and all [F]created [Bb]things,
[Gm]Above all wisdom and all [Bb/F]the ways [Ebmaj7]of [Bb]man,
[Eb]You were here before the world [F]began.
[Bb]Above all [F]kingdoms, above [Bb]all thrones,
[Bb]Above [Eb]all wonders, the [F]world has ever [Bb]known,
[Gm]Above all wealth and [Bb/F]treasurers of [Eb]the [Gm]earth,
[Eb]There’s no way to measure [D]what You’re worth.
[F/A]Crucified, laid behind [Bb]a stone,
[Bb]You lived [Cm7]to [F]die rejected and [Bbmaj7]alone,
[F]Like [Gm]a rose, trampled [Bb/F]on [Eb]the ground,
[Bb/D]You took [Cm7]the [Bb/D]fall and [Eb]thought [Bb/F]of me [Eb/G]above [Bb/D]all.
[Bb/D]2.
