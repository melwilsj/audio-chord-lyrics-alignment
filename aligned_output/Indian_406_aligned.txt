[D]Make me a servant, humble and [A]meek. [D]Lord, let me lift [A]up, those [D]who are weak, [Gb]And [Bm]may the prayer of my heart always [Gm]be, [D]Make me a [A]servant, make [D]me a servant, [A]Make [D]me a servant [A]today!
[G]1. [A7]Even though You were in the form [D]of God, [Gb]You [Bm]took the form of a slave.
[Bm]You accepted [Gm]death even [D]on a cross, [A]So God [D]exalted Your name.
[D]2. [A]‘Ere [D]You formed [A]me in [G]my [D]mother’s womb, You called me [Gbm]by my [Bm]name.
[Bm]And [G]You touched [A]my mouth and [D]appointed [A]me, A prophet [Bm]to the [Gbm]world.
[Gbm]3. [Bm]May [G]I heal the [A]sick [D]and the crippled bind,
[D]Bring back [Em7]the [A7]sheep that stray.
[A7]May I seek the [Dmaj7]lost and the [Gb]weak [Bm]make strong, With justice feed the poor.
[Gm]4.
