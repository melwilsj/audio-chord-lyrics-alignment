[Db]My heart’s like a flute and I want [Gb]to play all [Db]day, Jesus [Gb]Christ [Db]is my [Ab7]music master.
[Db]Deep from my heart flows a simple [Gb]melody, Great is His [Db]love, love without end! (2)
[Gb]1. Once [Db]I met the Lord on the way,
[Db]Deep was His gaze, [Gb]kind was His smile, True were His [Db]words, gentle His touch, He brought me peace and freedom.
[Db]2. He’s my [Gb]shepherd, He [Db]is my guide, Dark be the [Dbm]night, Christ [A]is my [Abm]light, [Dbm]Nothing I fear, Jesus [Abm]is [B]near,
[E]He leads me to the Kingdom.
[E]3. T’wards the land of [A/E]promise we [E]walk, There to [Ab]find [Db]peace, there to find joy, There [Gb]to find love: God [Db]has [Gb]prepared,
[Gb]A [Db]banquet for His people.
[Db]4.
