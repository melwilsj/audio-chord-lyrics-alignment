[G]I who made the stars of night,
[G]I will make their [D]darkness [G]bright,
[G]Who [Em7]will bear My light [Cmaj7]to [Am]them? [Bm]Whom [G]shall [C6]I [D]send?
[D]Here [G]I am, Lord, is it I, Lord?

[G]I will [C]hold [Am7]Your [D]people in [G]my heart.

[D/F#]I [G]will break their hearts of stone,
[G]Give them hearts for love alone.
[Em7]I will speak [G]My [C]word [Am]to them. [Gmaj7]Whom [D]shall I send?
[G]2. I, [D]the Lord [G]of wind and flame, I will tend [Am7]the [G/B]poor [C]and [D]lame. I [G]will set a feast for them, My hand will [C]save.
[Am7]Finest [G]bread I will provide, Till their hearts be satisfied,
[G]I will
