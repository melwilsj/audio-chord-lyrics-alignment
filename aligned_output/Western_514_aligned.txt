[D]Sing [G]a [D]new song [B7]unto the [Em]Lord,
[Em]Let your [Am]song be [D]sung from [G]mountains high, Sing a new [D]song [B/F#]unto the [Em]Lord,
[Em]Singing [Am7]alleluia!
[G]1. [D]Yahwehâ€™s people, [Am7]dance [D/A]for [G]joy, O come [Am]before [D]the Lord,
[G]And play [D]for Him on glad [C/G]tambourines, And let [D]your trumpet [G]sound.
[G]Rise [C]O [B/F#]children, from [Em]your sleep, Your [Am7]Saviour now [D]has come.
[G]He has turned your [D]sorrow to [B7]joy,
[B7]And [Em]filled your [Am7]soul [G]with song.
[D]Glad [Am7]my soul, [D]for I [Em]have seen, [Am7]The glory [D]of the [G]Lord.
[D]The trumpet [Am7]sounds, [C]the [D]dead [C]shall be raised, [Am7]I know [D]my [G]Saviour lives.
