[Bb]1. [Cm7]Blest be [Bb]the Lord, [Cm7]blest [F]be the [Bb]Lord, The God of mercy, [Cm7]the [F6]God who [Bb]saves. I shall not [Cm7]fear the [F/C]dark of [Bb]night,
[Eb]Nor the arrow [F]that flies by day.
[Ebdim]2. He will [F]release me from [Eb6]the nets of [Bb]sinful ones, [Eb]He will [F]protect me from their wicked hands. Beneath the shadow of [Eb6]His wings I [Bb]will rejoice, To [Cm7]find [F]a dwelling place [Bb]secure.
[Bb]3. I need [Cm7]not [F]shrink before the [Bb]terrors of the night,
[Cm7]Nor [F]stand alone before [Bb]the light of [Cm]day.
[F]No harm shall [Bb]come [Eb]to me, no [F]arrows strike me down,
[F]No evil settle [Eb6]in my [Bb]soul.
[Bb]4. Although [Eb]a thousand ones have [F]fallen at my [Ebmaj7]side, Iâ€™ll not [Bb]be shaken [F]with [Eb6]the Lord at [Bb]hand.
[Bb]His faithful [Cm7]love is [F]all the armour [Bb]that I need, To [Cm7]wage [F]my battle with [Bb]the foe.
[Bb]5.
