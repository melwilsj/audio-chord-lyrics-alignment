[Em]1. [Am7]Longing for light, [D]we wait [Em]in darkness, Longing [C]for [D]truth we turn [G]to You. Make [D]us Your own Your [Cmaj7]holy people, Light [Am7]for the world [D7]to [C]see.
[C]Christ, [G]be our light, shine in our hearts, [A]Shine [Am]through [G]the darkness.
[G]Christ be our light, shine [C]in [Am]Your [D]Church, [G]Gathered today.
[G]2. [D]Longing for peace our [Em]world [Am7]is troubled, [D]Longing for [G]hope many despair.
[D]Your word alone [Gmaj7]has powâ€™r [C]to save us, Make us [G]Your [C]living [Gmaj7]voice.
[Gmaj7]3. Longing for food many [Bm]are hungry, Longing [Am]for [D]water, [G]many still thirst. Make us Your [C]bread, [D]broken for [G]others, Shared until [D]all are fed.
[G]4. Longing for [D]shelter, many are [G]homeless, Longing for [Am6]warmth, [D]many are [G]cold. Make [C]us [Am7]Your building, [D]sheltering [G]others, [C]Walls made [G]of living stone.
[G]5. Many the gifts, many [D]the [G]people, Many the hearts [Em]that yearn [C]to belong. Let [D]us [G]be servants to [D6]one another, [Em]Making Your [Am7]kingdom come.
[D]6.
