[A]1. My [E]Jesus, my Savior,
[Gbm]Lord there is [Dbm]none [D]like You,
[D]All of [A]my days I want to praise, The wonders of [G]Your mighty [E]love. [A]My [E]comfort, my [Gbm]shelter,
[Gbm]Tower of [Dbm]refuge and [D]strength, Let every [A]breath, all that I am, Never cease to [G]worship You.
[Amaj7]2. Shout to the [Gbm]Lord all [D]the earth, let us [E]sing,
[Amaj7]Power and [D6]majesty, praise to [E]the King. [Gbm]Mountains bow down and [D]the seas will roar, At [E]the sound of Your name.
[E]I sing for [Gbm]joy at the [Dmaj7]work of Your [E]hands,
[E]Forever [A]I’ll [D6]love You, forever I’ll [E]stand.
[Amaj7]Nothing [Gbm]compares to the [D]promise I [E]have [A]in You.
[A]3.
