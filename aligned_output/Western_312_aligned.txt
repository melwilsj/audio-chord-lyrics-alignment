[D]1. In Christ alone, my hope is found,
[D]He is my Light, my Strength, my Song.
[D]This [Am]Cornerstone, this Solid Ground,
[Am]Firm through the fiercest drought and storm. What heights [C]of love, what depths [D]of [G]peace! When [C]fears are stilled, when strivings [D]cease! My [G]Comforter, my [C]All in All,
[G]Here in [C]the love of [D]Christ I [G]stand.
[G]2. In Christ alone! Who took [D]on flesh, [C]Fullness of [D]God in [G]helpless babe! This Gift of love and [D]righteousness,
[C]Scorned by the ones He [D]came [G]to save. Till on [C]that cross as Jesus [D]died,
[D]The [C]wrath of God was [D]satisfied. For [G]every sin on Him [D]was laid, Here in the death of Christ I live.
[D]3. There in the [G6]ground His [D]body lay, Light of the world [G]by darkness slain. Then bursting [C]forth in [G]glorious day, Up [C]from the [D]grave [G]He rose again!
[G]And [C]as He stands [D]in victory,
[D]Sin’s [C]curse has lost its [D]grip on me.
[D]For [G]I am His [C]and [D]He is mine,
[D]Bought [C]with the precious [G]blood [E]of Christ.
[A]No guilt in [E]life, no fear in [A]death, This is the power of Christ in me. From life’s first cry, to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny.
[A]No [D]power of hell, no [E]scheme of [A]man, Can [D]ever pluck, [Gbm]me [E]from His hand. [A]Till He returns or calls [E]me [A]home, Here in the power of Christ,
