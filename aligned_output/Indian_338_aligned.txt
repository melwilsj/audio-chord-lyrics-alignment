[Ab]1. Jesus has a table spread, where [Bbm7]the saints of God are fed, [Eb]He invites His chosen [Abmaj7]people, “Come and dine.”
[Abmaj7]With His manna He doth feed, [Bbm]and supplies [Eb]our every need, O ‘tis sweet to [Ab]sup with Jesus [Eb]all the time.
[Eb]“Come and dine,” [Ab]the Master calleth, [Bb/F]“come and dine.” You may feast [Eb]at Jesus’ [Ab]table all the [Fm]time.
[Fm]He who fed [Bbm]the multitude, turned [Eb/F]the water into wine, To [Db]the [Ab]hungry calleth now, “come and dine.”
[Ab]2. [Bbm]The disciples came to land, thus [Eb7]obeying Christ’s command, For the Master [Ab]called unto them, “Come and dine.”
[Ab]There they found [Bbm]their hearts’ desire,
[Bbm]Bread and [Eb]fish upon the fire,
[Eb]Thus He [Ab]satisfies the hungry [Eb]ev’ry time.
[Eb]Soon the Lamb will [Ab/Eb]take His bride, [Bb/F]to be ever at His side,
[Eb7]All the [Ab]hosts of heaven will assembled [Fm7]be.
[Fm7]O [Bbm]‘twill be a [Eb7]glorious sight, all the saints [Ab]in
