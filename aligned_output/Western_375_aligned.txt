[Bb]1. [Cm]And gathers [Abmaj7]the lambs in [Bb6]His arms, [Ebmaj7]Holding [Bb]them [Fm]carefully close to [Bb]His heart, Leading [Eb]them home.
[Eb]2. Say [Bb7]to the [Eb]cities [Ab]of Judah: “Prepare [Bbm7]the way [C]of [Fm]the Lord.”

[Eb]3. [Ab]I, myself, [Bb]will shepherd [Cm]them,
[Cm]For [Ab]others have led [Bb7]them astray.
[Ebmaj7]The [Bb]lost, [Fm]I will rescue [Bb]and heal their [Eb]wounds, And pasture [Bb7]them, [Eb]giving them rest.
[Ab]4. Come [Bbm7]unto Me,
[C]If you [Fm]are heavily burdened,
[Bb]And take [Eb]My yoke [Cm]upon [Ab]your shoulders,
[Ab]I [Fm]will give [Bb]you rest.
