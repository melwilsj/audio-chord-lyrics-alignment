[E]1. You are my strength when I [Dbm]am weak,
[Dbm]You are the [E]treasure that [A]I seek. You are [E]my [B]all [E]in all.
[E]Seeking You as a precious jewel, Lord to give up I’ll [A6]be a fool,
[A6]You are my [B]all [E]in all.
[Dbm]Jesus, Lamb [E]of [A]God, Worthy [B]is Your [E]name. [B](2)
[Dbm]2. [Abm]Taking [A]my sin, [B]my [E7/G#]cross, [E]my shame, Rising [B/D#]again I’ll bless [Dbm]Your name.
[Dbm]You [E/G#]are my all [A]in all.
[A]When I [B]fall down [Dbm]You [B]pick [E]me up, When [B/D#]I am dry [Dbm]You fill my cup, [E]You are my all [A]in all.
[A]3.
