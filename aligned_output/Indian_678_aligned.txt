[Eb]With you [Ab]as my guide, Iâ€™ll not [Eb]want,
[Cm]You are my [Fm]Shepherd, [Bb]Lord, nothing shall I [Eb]fear.
[Eb]1. [Ab]In pastures fresh and green, You give [Eb]my soul [Fm]repose. Near [Bb]cool and restful waters, [Eb]My spirit You revive.
[Ab]2. [Eb]In vales of [Ab6]gloom and death, [Eb]No evil [Ab]shall I [Eb]dread.
[Bb/F]Your strength and peaceful presence,
[Bb/F]Will [Ab]be my comfort sure.
[Ab]3. A [Eb]banquet [Ab]You have spread, [Bb]While foes in envy [Eb]watch. My head You have anointed, My cup now overflows.
[Eb]4. Your loving [Bb]favour, Lord, Shall surely follow me, Until one day in heaven, [Ab]For ever shall I dwell.
[Ab]5.
